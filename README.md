## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Second Year Software Engineering student @ McMaster University.

Currently, I'm in the process of creating a 1-1 word translator between English and Japanese. This webscrapper has been my passion project for the past 2 years, with the idea originally stemming from needing a tool to assist with my Japanese studies (which I have been learning for the past 5 years)
